# SaND-Replication :hospital:

This project was replication of the methodology presented in this paper: [**Title: Attend and diagnose: clinical time series analysis using attention models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03905). Since the data preprocessing and subsequent steps were computational intensive and it was impossible to provide the data here (Its health data and requires special access). So we only have provided the code that we worked on. The code was based of this [repo](https://github.com/khirotaka/SAnD).

The notebooks are quite explanatory and are easy to follow along but due to data constraint as mentioned above it might not be possible to run it. Though you can use any other data that you would like and run it for that. 

### How to Run 
There are two notebooks *SNaD_train* and *SNaD_val*. Former is used to create the inputs for the latter hence run the former first.
